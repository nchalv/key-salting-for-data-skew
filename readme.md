## Key Salting for mitigating the effects of data Skew in Stateful, Streaming Operations

This project is focusing on using an adaptive key salting technique to tackle
the problem of data skew in **Stateful, Streaming** workloads, especially using
*Apache Spark Structured Streaming* as a streaming, distributed processing engine.

In `./source-creation` we include the code developed for creating streaming data
sources, using *Apache Kafka*.
